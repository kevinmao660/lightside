    <h1 style ="color:cyan"> Light Side of the Force</h1>
    <p style="color:cyan"> In Starwars, there are two sides of the force, the light side, and dark side.
        George Lucas took the idea of the force from a japanese movie, The Hidden Fortress in which the people used a "force"to move objects. The Jedi use the light side of the force to defeat the sith who use the dark side which drove them crazy. The light side gives you access to great power such as great leaps and mind tricks. Also, they can come back as force ghosts if they die. In there culture, there is a child who will completely destroy the sith. The light side is based on happieness, joy, and anti violence. They use light side uses the force to build lightsabers and protect themselves and their powers are based on defence. The Jedi believe that they are mere tools of the force.
